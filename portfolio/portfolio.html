                        Hello! I'm Austin Polk, and welcome to my website. 
                        I recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from UT Dallas, 
                        and now I have returned as a graduate student. My focus is in intelligent 
                        systems, but I have a passion for software development as a whole. In my 
                        free time I like to work on personal projects, which helps me learn and 
                        solve real-world problems that I encounter. Currently, I'm very interested 
                        in applying machine learning to a range of prediction tasks, such as global 
                        climate and stock market forecasts. In the future, I hope to build software 
                        that empowers real people with information that can positively affect their 
                        decision making. Whether it's mundane or monumental, I want to help where I 
                        can.

                                I worked on this project during senior design as a sort of capstone. Me and 
                                my team implemented the front- and backend for an app that forecasts the
                                weather for multiple counties in North Texas. My main contribution was toward
                                the prediction algorithm that created forecasts. Although fairly rudimentary,
                                it inspired me to focus on forecasting as a potential research avenue for
                                my personal projects and career.

                                I created this project during my Natural Language Processing class. It features
                                a basic console interface wherein a user answers questions about movie 
                                preferences and receives recommendations. While the user interaction definitely
                                needs some work, what I'm most proud of is the recommendation system. It pulls
                                the most relevant parts of user input and interacts with a movie database to
                                query for movies the user might like. In the future, I'd like to return to this
                                project and make it a fully-fledged, although simple, web app.
